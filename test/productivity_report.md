# Productivity Analysis Report for FlexiSAF Edusoft Limited

**Period:** 11 March – 30 August 2024  
**Subjects:** 10 interns; **Styles:** Remote vs On-site  

## 1. Introduction
This report examines how hours worked influence tasks completed and whether work style (remote vs on-site) modifies this relationship over the specified period.

## 2. Methods
We simulated intern data for 10 employees, recording hours, tasks, and style. A linear regression with interaction term was fitted.

## 3. Results
- **Regression coefficients** indicate baseline productivity and style-specific effects.  
- **Visualisations** illustrate task–hours trends and model fit.

## 4. Discussion
On-site work yielded marginally higher tasks per hour, suggesting benefits from in-person collaboration.

## 5. Conclusion
FlexiSAF Edusoft Limited may expect modest productivity gains on-site. Further validation with real data is recommended.
